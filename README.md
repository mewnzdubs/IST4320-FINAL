# IST4320-FINAL
This is an upgraded version of my Activity 8 submission. I liked the concept and wanted to build on it!

Changelog:

The final code includes enhancements to the user interface and functionality. It introduces a rainbow-colored "By: Branden Munar" text at the top, making it visually appealing. The credit card input field now automatically formats the input with hyphens, limits the length to 16 characters, and removes any existing hyphens for convenience. The window size is set to 500x500 pixels, and the background color is a light gray shade. The button fonts have been modified to make them larger and more modern. Overall, these changes improve the aesthetics and user experience of the program.

In terms of improvement, the "Methods" button suggests two ways to enhance the program further. First, saving the card information to a secure database would provide a more secure and organized way of storing user data. Second, implementing a card number validation algorithm specific to each card type would ensure that only valid card numbers are accepted, adding an extra layer of accuracy and security to the program. These improvements would enhance the program's functionality and user trust in handling sensitive credit card information.

Even though there is no database capability:
The provided code serves as an example of how user data, specifically credit card information, can be captured and stored without appropriate security measures. This raises awareness about the risks associated with mishandling sensitive data and highlights the importance of implementing robust security practices. It serves as a cautionary reminder of the ethical responsibilities involved in working with personal information and the need for secure coding practices to protect user privacy and prevent potential misuse of data.
